    "description_long": "<p>It is an architectural masterpiece that occupies a large part of Yerevan’s center and a great opportunity for travelers who are looking for free things to do in Yerevan. The complex was designed by the legendary Armenian architect Alexander Tamanyan, who was the main architect of Yerevan city. Although he designed it, the Yerevan Cascade Complex was built after Tamanyan’s death in the 1970s and over time became one of the main places to visit in Yerevan. Erected from limestone, this mesmerizing monument is a one-of-a-kind structure that is basically an enormous staircase. It connects northern Yerevan to the center in a very unique way. The Yerevan Cascades has several levels and each level has a different look and design to it.</p>",
